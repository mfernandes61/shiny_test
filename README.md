# shiny_test
test for CRUK-CI shiy apps training environment

This builds a container with all the infra-structure (Shiny server, R with req. packages)
to run some Shiny apps that CRUK-CI have developed for use in our Bioinformatics training courses.

This repo pulls in the apps code from their own GH repos.
